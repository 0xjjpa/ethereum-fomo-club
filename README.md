# Ethereum Fomo Club

You _knew_ you should had invested. Inspired by its [Bitcoin](https://bitcoinfomo.club/) doppelganger.

Available on [IPFS](https://ipfs.fleek.co/ipfs/QmYki6oQRsMc1FxfZWTZAgi3rMZySBYXb3W5TdtGxN4dpk) and [boring domain name](https://ethereumfomo.club/). Relies on Coinbase [spot price API](https://developers.coinbase.com/api/v2#get-spot-price) to fetch Ethereum historical data. Tracking by [Fathom](https://usefathom.com/).

# Development

```sh
$ cd site
$ yarn dev
```

# Deployment
